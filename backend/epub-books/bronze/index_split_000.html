            This is not book of philosophy. It is exhortation. I hardly have
            anything to say to most who aren’t like me, still less do I care
            about convincing. This is account of my reveries. I tried to put, as
            brief and simple as I could, the thought that motivates me and the
            problem faced by life in ascent and decline.

            If you look around eyes of some people you see a kind of demented
            energy. It’s pure anger or lust for power with nothing more. I hate
            to dirty these pages with mention of names of nobodies in our time.
            But if you see photo of Hillary Clintong or Adam Schiff with his
            eyes bugged out on stims and antidepressants or who knows what, you
            know what I mean. There is a crease around the eye that tells it, it
            looks like cyborg gone off-script, these people have an inhuman gaze
            and are vehicles for something else. You see this also in the chiefs
            of the EU bureaucracy with tiny moleman eyes behind small glasses,
            and the tiny lenses that reflect light. You see it in the dead robot
            eyes of the new hue-man automatons running government departments,
            the DMV, the brutal zombies running the security in airports or
            hospital “health care” rooms under vicious yellow fluorescent
            lights.

                    just an eldritch quality embedded in things and on some
                    faces. The same was said of Hades. Some said he would feel a
                    great shame when some other god drew back the veil on the
                    underworld so all the vile things that are there could be
                    seen. Is this Hades of our time capable of shame? I heard

                    frightful things revealed when the sea recedes before a

            The secret things show in dreams. Heraclitus say, “All the things
            you see awake are death, all the things you see asleep are sleep.”
            He was trying to be coy! In his day many gods, clove-footed satyr,
            and other things showed themselves to men in dreams.

            There was Empedocles, a philosopher, man of high vision. He jumped
            into volcano Aetna in Sicily because he knew he would be reborn as a
            god. Now imagine yourself in front of rim of Aetna. It’s dry and
            sandy. You feel the heat but is not like you thought it might be. Is
            not Romantic. Is just hot, dry, you can’t breathe, and the smell of
            infernal sulfur and wet earth and even worse things triggers an old
            memory or instinct in you to run. You’re brought to face with a
            vehemence and brutality of rock and you start to feel dizzy staring
            in. Molten rock in your nostrils and it’s not just that it scares
            you. If it were great fear, that could be a spur to action. But it
            fills your nostrils with banality and dullness of plain molten dust,
            you see gray and black. It reminds you of torrid summer afternoon by
            abandoned gas station, you are stranded on dirt road, choked by heat
            and so much dust. You see flames in the hole but it lacks the
            romance of fire as you imagined it. Is this it? It seems like
            nothing to you, because to your eye it’s nothing. So you pull away
            from it. You’re not reborn as a god, you remain a mule. Your lying
            mind now comes up with many thoughts about why it’s right to pull
            back. Why, of course! There’s a nice meal to have, a glass of wine.
            Maybe there’s a girl waiting. Her pussy is warm and inviting.
            Empedocles was deluded.

            No, don’t jump in Aetna or Mauna Loa or Puyehue or Eyjafjallajökull,
            Titans of the world, even if you get yourself to do it, it won’t
            work now. These portals are closed for ages. But! Other doors are
            closed to you too. What Mount Aetna was to Empedocles—is there
            something like that to you? Is there something like that at all
            anymore?

            Life has a thing inside it that reaches beyond itself. This is

            I tell you other story. In Stone Age man appears, very strong
            shoulders, with club in hand. He is believed by the people to be a
            son of some god…of a mortal woman who cucked her husband with a god.
            As child he already displays superhuman strength. When he grows he
            goes into the deepest wild to fight great cave lion. He emerges from
            cave with skin of lion on his back. Lion had been eating and working
            terror in the people, but now he wears this terror on his shoulders.
            He carries lion mane on head, lion pelt on back and a great club in
            the hand. This man comes to be worshiped by the people: his progeny
            become lines of kings, of Sparta and many other places. What was his
            act of foundation? He slaughtered monsters, he made the seaways
            known to man and tamed the rock-face. But don’t forget the lion-skin
            on his shoulders. This was lion of Nemea. Do you understand what
            Nemesis is? There is in nature a great purgative function. You know
            about monkeys who switch sex in certain times. In lake of some
            reptiles, when they overpopulate it and there is a surplus of
            refuse, there is trigger in nature: a monster is born to them. A
            lizard many times the size of a normal one is born, who deals out
            destruction and culls the lake. The Greeks believed in this great
            power and worshiped its justice. In Bible it appears as allegory of
            the Flood, which in fact refers to the irrepressible spirit of the
            Sea Peoples, and the divine justice they brought to cities whose
            life had grown pointless, and a great ugliness on the world. You
            bring lion cub into the house, but Aeschylus say, it will become a
            priest of doom when it reaches age: in nature there is irrepressible
            force. Its violence against the surfeit of populations is divine
            justice. Its destruction of the feeble designs of reason, the
            pointless words of man—this is beautiful. This what the power of
            Nemesis means: few are chosen to wield it, fewer realize they are
            chosen or know what to do with it. When Hercules puts on the power
            of Nemesis on his shoulders he becomes hero who makes the world tame
            and safe for cities of real men. But that was in his time, and ours
            is an age of surfeit. It is different function. The star of Nemesis
            is sure to return, and it must already be burning inside some of
            you.
